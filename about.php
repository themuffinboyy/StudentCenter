                <h1>About the Card</h1><hr>
                <p>The RowanCard is the official photo identification of the University and should be carried at all times.  
                Although one card, it has three uses and gives students access to many privileges.</p>

                <strong>Identification</strong>
                <p>The photo on the card identifies the carrier as the owner of the card. The card also identifies a person's 
                status on campus (i.e., student or employee), entitling him or her to a specific set of privileges. 
                A swipe of the magnetic stripe on the back will give students access to:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>RowanCard 'Boro Bucks Account</li>
                    <li>Meal Plan Account</li>
                    <li>Dining Dollar Account</li>
                    <li>University bookstore services</li>
                    <li>Rec Center privileges</li>
                    <li>Mail Room privileges</li>
                    <li>Campbell Library privileges</li>
                    <li>After-hours building access (where available)</li>
                    <li>Vending machines</li>
                    <li>Campus copiers</li>
                    <li>Print labs</li>
                    <li>Off-Campus Merchants</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The RowanCard is the property of Rowan University and is non-transferable. 
                Only the person whose photo is on the card will be permitted to spend funds from the accounts on the card. 
                Cards will be confiscated if presented by someone other than the cardholder or if the card is involved in inappropriate 
                or illegal use. Fraudulent use of another person's card will result in disciplinary action.</p>

                <strong>Meal Plan/Dining Dollar Account</strong>
                <p>When students purchase meal plans through dining services, they also receive Dining Dollars and 'Boro Bucks.</p>

                <p>Students can use their meal plan accounts to purchase food in either the Marketplace or from a "meal equivalent" 
                menu in the Food Court. If they go beyond their allocated meals, the university will automatically draw money from their 
                Dining Dollar or Boro Bucks account. Dining Dollars can be used to purchase food from any on-campus food location.</p>

                <p>Setting up a meal plan is easy. Contact the Bursar's Office at (856) 256-4150.  Better yet, stop by in person to purchase a 
                meal plan. The office is located in Savitz Hall on the ground level. Payment is required at the time of purchase. Meal plans can 
                be decreased through the second week of classes only.</p>

                <strong>RowanCard 'Boro Bucks Account</strong>
                <p>Students can avoid carrying cash or credit cards by depositing money in their RowanCard 'Boro Bucks Account. 
                The money in this account can be used to purchase a variety of goods and services on campus and at over 80 locations off campus. 
                Money deposited into the 'Boro Bucks account is drawn down with each purchase. 'Boro Bucks balances roll over from year to year
                and do not expire. Upon graduation, withdrawal or termination of employment, refunds will be issued for remaining funds over ten 
                dollars.  The purchase of pre-paid cards of any kind or gift certificates are NOT permitted using Boro Bucks. Students cannot make
                cash withdrawals from their RowanCard. Check account balances at <a href="myrowancard.rowan.edu">myrowancard.rowan.edu</a>.</p>
